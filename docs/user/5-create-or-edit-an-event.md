## Venue, online or hybrid

If you created venue(s) (see [[3. Create or edit a venue]]), you'll be able to select it in the dropdown. You can also choose to have an online event and you'll get a field to enter your online link.

To have an hybrid event, with both a venue and an online link, you'll need to add a second time the Venue block.

You can also add any block in the body

Then on the right sidebar, under event, you can add your featured image, and different details, as well as your topic.
